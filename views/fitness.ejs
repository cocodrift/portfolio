        <h2>Home Workouts (Bodyweight)</h2>
         <p>For most people, at-home solo workouts mean bodyweight-only exercises rather than studio classes and gym sessions that call for weights and other gear.</p>
          <p>Although this might appear limiting, bodyweight workouts can be highly effective. They challenge your form, offering opportunities for improvement without needing gear or ample space. Below are insights into top bodyweight exercises for a comprehensive strength training regimen at home.</p> 
         <div class="" id="prefers">
           
            <h3>I Prefer </h3>
                 <h1>AIR SQUATS</h1>
                 <video autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" muted="" class="mntl-gif__video universal-image__image" width="400" height="200" aria-label="squat" src="/videos/squat.mp4">
                </video>
                 <div class="card">
                <h2>steps</h2>
            <p>Step 1 <br> <br> Begin by standing with your feet positioned shoulder-width apart. Initiate the mp4ement by lowering your hips downward and backward, mimicking the motion of sitting in a chair. Descend as far as you comfortably can while maintaining the natural arch of your lower back.</p>
            <p>Step 2 <br> <br> Next, push through your feet to rise back to a standing position. Focus on exerting force against the floor as you stand, ensuring your weight remains centered in your heels throughout the mp4ement.</p>
            <p>Continue performing the exercise in repetitions. Maintain an upright chest and engage your core muscles to keep your torso stable. You should feel a significant engagement in your lower body muscles and abdominal muscles during the exercise.</p>
              </div>
               <h1>PUSH-UPS</h1>
               <video autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" muted="" class="mntl-gif__video universal-image__image" width="400" height="200" aria-label="squat" src="/videos/pushups.mp4">
            </video>
            <div class="card">
                 <h2>steps</h2>
                 <p>Step 1 <br> <br> Begin by assuming a plank position with your shoulders directly above your wrists, forming a straight line from your shoulders to your heels, and engaging your core muscles.</p>

                 <p>Step 2 <br> <br> Lower your body by bending your elbows back at a 45-degree angle, gradually mp4ing towards the ground.</p>
                 
                 <p>Step 3 <br> <br>Next, push yourself back up while maintaining a strong plank position. Repeat the mp4ement.</p>
                 
                 <p>Step 4 <br> <br>Ensure that your elbows maintain the 45-degree angle during the descent, avoiding the tendency to flare them out to the sides, which can strain the shoulders, as noted by Rosante.</p>
                 
                 <p>   For a modification, you can perform the same exercise with your hands elevated on a couch, chair, or the edge of a table, which will reduce the intensity on your upper body.</p>
                 
                 <p>To increase the challenge, perform a regular push-up but slow down the lowering phase. Aim to take five or six counts before reaching the floor with your chest.</p>
                 
            </div>
                 <h1>BURPESS</h1>
                 <video autoplay="" loop="" playsinline="" muted="" class="mntl-gif__video universal-image__image" width="400" height="200" aria-label="squat" src="/videos/burpee.mp4">
              </video>
              <div class="card">
                   <h2>steps</h2>
                   <p>Step 1<br><br>Starting from a standing position, squat down and place your hands beneath your shoulders on the ground. Then, jump your feet back to assume a push-up position.</p>

                   <p>Step 2<br><br>Lower your body to the ground, then push back up. Quickly jump your feet forward to meet your hands.</p>
                   
                   <p>Step 3<br><br>Drive upward through your heels, jumping straight up while clapping your hands overhead. Land softly and repeat the sequence.</p>
                   
                   <p>Step 4<br><br>Maintain a tight core and neutral spine throughout the exercise to ensure proper form and avoid arching or rounding your back.</p>
                   
                   <p>For a modification, eliminate the jumps and instead step backward and forward during the burpee. Come to your toes at the top instead of hopping. You can also keep your chest off the floor, maintaining a plank position at the bottom of the mp4ement.</p>
                   
                   <p>To increase the intensity, focus on speed while maintaining proper form. This will challenge both your strength and cardio endurance.</p>
